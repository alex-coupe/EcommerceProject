E-Commerce Project

## What is this project

This is primarily a tool for me to learn how to construct an Api with microservices architecture as well as deploying using Docker and managing using Kubernetes as well handling CI/CD via Github Actions and DockerHub as well as how to build a front end using NextJS. Its better to learn with a real world project. The goal is to make a website where admins can log in and add products and categories etc which will then be rendered as a shopping website - think Amazon but a 1000th of the scale. I may add fake checkout payment methods, again not sure.

## What technologies are you using?

So the backend will split into microservices so I will probably use a mixture of technologies (maybe not recommended for an app you plan to put in production unless you have teams with different skills working on the microservices) variety is the spice of life. I will be certainly using .Net 5 and Node (TypeScript flavour) along with Mongo, SQL and Redis. I may add PHP into the mix, not sure yet. Docker will be used along with Kubernetes and frontend will be NextJS, which is a server side rendering framework for ReactJS

## Can I use this project in someway?

Feel free

## Can I contribute?

Sure, happy to review any pull requests

## Will you finish this?

I hope so but we can never predict the future. All projects that I see out to do are because I want to learn about a particular technology and want to do it in a less boring way than making a simple todo application.
